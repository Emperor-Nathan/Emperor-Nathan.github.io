This chart shows four language editions (English, Polish, Catalan, Icelandic) of Wikipedia by their number of monthly pageviews. These four languages have very different numbers of native speakers, and are all native to the developed world (so that disparities in Internet access aren't a problem).

The languages with fewer speakers/views have more month-to-month variation in their view counts.
