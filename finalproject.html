		<h1>Final project</h1>
		<h2>Nathan Holmes-King</h2>
		<p>This project is about viewership of Wikipedia. All data is sourced from <a href='https://stats.wikimedia.org/'>https://stats.wikimedia.org</a>.</p>

		<h2>Visualization 1</h2>
		<p>This chart shows four language editions (English, Polish, Catalan, Icelandic) of Wikipedia by their number of monthly pageviews. These four languages have very different numbers of native speakers, and are all native to the developed world (so that disparities in Internet access aren't a problem).</p>
        <p>The languages with fewer speakers/views have more month-to-month variation in their view counts.</p>

		<p>Data from October 2022.</p>

		<h2>Visualization 3</h2>
		<p>This chart shows English Wikipedia views by device type by month. Hover over the pie chart slices to show more information. Click the arrows for the left chart to advance the timeframe, and click "Play animation" to auto-advance.</p>

		<h2>Visualization 4</h2>
		<p>This shows the top three most-viewed English Wikipedia articles by month, from December 2015 to October 2022. When hovered over, a tooltip will display the title of the article.</p>

		<p>Potential shortcomings:</p>
		<ul>
    		<li>Obviously, since this is the English Wikipedia, it will be biased towards English-speaking countries.</li>
    		<li>For events that happened in the last few days of the month, the views will be split across two months, and will add up to less.</li>
    		<li>This data only tracks views for a certain pagename, so pages that were renamed several times will not appear, as the views will be split between the different names.</li>
    	</ul>
